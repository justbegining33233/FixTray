## 🔄 Workflow

### Shop Onboarding
1. Shop registers via signup form
2. Credentials stored locally
3. Registration sent to pending approval
4. Admin reviews and approves/denies
5. Approved shops can log in and access system

### Work Order Lifecycle
1. Customer/Shop creates work order
2. Assigned to technician
3. Tech updates status, adds parts/labor
4. Estimate generated and sent for approval
5. Customer approves/rejects
6. Work completed and status updated
7. Payment processed and order closed

## 🚧 Future Enhancements


## 🐛 Known Limitations


## 📝 Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file for production:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=your-api-url
DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
```

### QuickBooks Online (Vercel Production)

Shop Books syncs to QuickBooks Online with OAuth. Set these on the Production environment. Do not commit the secret.

```env
INTUIT_CLIENT_ID=
INTUIT_CLIENT_SECRET=
INTUIT_REDIRECT_URI=https://fixtray.app/api/shop/quickbooks/callback
INTUIT_ENVIRONMENT=production
```

Use `INTUIT_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox` only for a sandbox company. The redirect URI must match the Intuit app exactly. Shops do not paste these values. CSV download stays an optional escape hatch.

---

## Standalone Socket Server (local dev)

Use the standalone Socket.IO server to run real-time features separately from the Next.js app. This is useful for local integration testing and debugging.

Important: **the standalone server requires the same `JWT_SECRET` as your main app**. Put it in `.env.local` (or export it in your shell) before starting the server.

Run the server:

```bash
# from repository root
node socket-server.js
```

Health check:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/health
# returns: { "status": "ok", "connected": <number> }
```

Run quick transport tests (requires `JWT_SECRET` in `.env.local` or your environment):

```bash
# polling only
node socket-polling-client.js

# websocket only
node socket-ws-client.js

# end-to-end broadcast test
node temp-socket-e2e-3001.js
```

Enable verbose socket logs (developer-only):

```bash
# shows verbose server & engine logs
DEBUG=socket node socket-server.js

# enable client-side verbose logs
DEBUG=socket node socket-polling-client.js
```

Notes:
- Tokens must be signed with the same `JWT_SECRET` used by the main Next.js app.
- The client now decodes tokens locally without verifying the signature (to avoid exposing the symmetric secret in browser builds). Server-side verification remains authoritative — rely on API calls for security-sensitive checks.
- The server logs are verbose only when `DEBUG` includes `socket` or `NODE_ENV` is `development`.

## 🔒 Security Notes

**For Production:**

## 📦 Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)
```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

### Docker
```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Traditional Hosting
```bash
npm run build
# Upload .next/, public/, package.json, package-lock.json
# Run: npm install --production && npm start
```
